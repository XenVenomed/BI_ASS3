    "The dataset contains 2,111 records from individuals in Mexico, Peru, and Colombia, collected to estimate obesity levels based on eating habits and physical condition. The data includes 17 attributes covering demographics (age, gender, height, weight), eating habits (high-calorie food consumption, vegetable consumption, number of meals, water intake, alcohol consumption), and physical activity patterns (exercise frequency, technology usage time, transportation mode).\n",
    "\n",
    "A public health agency in Latin America aims to combat the rising obesity epidemic by implementing targeted intervention programs. The agency needs an automated system to classify individuals into obesity risk categories based on their lifestyle and physical characteristics. This classification will enable early identification of at-risk populations, personalized health recommendations, resource allocation for intervention programs, and monitoring of public health trends over time. The system will be deployed as a web-based screening tool accessible to healthcare providers and wellness centers across Mexico, Peru, and Colombia.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "business_objectives_comment = \"\"\"\n",
    "The primary business objectives focus on five key areas. First, supporting public health initiatives aimed at reducing obesity rates across the target population. Second, providing healthcare professionals with an accurate classification tool that identifies specific obesity risk categories, allowing for customized intervention strategies for each risk group. Third, helping health agencies allocate resources efficiently by identifying geographic regions and demographic groups with highest obesity risk. Fourth, enabling early detection of obesity risk before severe health complications develop. Finally, generating actionable insights about the relationship between lifestyle factors and obesity levels to inform public health policy decisions.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",

    "business_success_criteria_comment = \"\"\"\n",
    "The success of this business initiative will be measured through multiple criteria. The system should achieve 70% adoption rate among targeted healthcare facilities within the first year of deployment. Individuals identified as high-risk who receive targeted interventions should demonstrate measurable improvement, specifically BMI reduction of at least 2 points. The initiative should reduce overall healthcare costs related to obesity complications by 15% over 3 years through early intervention. Healthcare providers using the tool should report at least 80% satisfaction rating, measured through user surveys. The system should successfully screen at least 50,000 individuals within the first year across the three target countries. Finally, 90% of high-risk classifications should result in documented intervention actions by healthcare providers.\n",

    "The specific data mining goals focus on building a robust multi-class classifier that accurately predicts obesity levels across all seven categories: Insufficient Weight, Normal Weight, Overweight Level I, Overweight Level II, Obesity Type I, Obesity Type II, and Obesity Type III. The model should identify which eating habits and physical activity factors are most predictive of obesity levels to guide intervention design. Performance must be strong across all obesity categories, not just majority classes, ensuring reliable predictions for minority obesity types. The model should generalize well across different demographic groups including age ranges, genders, and geographic regions. Finally, the model's predictions must be interpretable and explainable to healthcare providers and patients, supporting trust and enabling actionable insights.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "data_mining_success_criteria_comment = \"\"\"\n",
    "The technical success criteria for the machine learning model are divided into six areas. Overall accuracy should reach at least 90 percent on held-out test data. Balanced performance requires macro-averaged F1-score of 0.85 or higher, minimum per-class recall of 0.75 for each obesity category, and macro-averaged precision of 0.85 or higher. The confusion matrix analysis should show that no obesity category is systematically misclassified as another. For generalization, performance on the validation set should be within 5 percent of training set performance to avoid overfitting. All results must be reproducible with documented random seeds and preprocessing steps. The model should outperform simple baselines such as random classifier or majority class classifier by at least 60 percentage points.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "ai_risk_aspects_comment = \"\"\"\n",
    "Several AI risk aspects require consideration for this deployment. Health data privacy presents risks of exposing sensitive information including weight and eating habits, which requires anonymization, secure data handling, and GDPR compliance. Bias and fairness concerns arise because the model may perform differently across genders, age groups, or geographic regions leading to unfair treatment. The concern is heightened since 77 percent of the data is synthetic and may not accurately represent real-world distributions. This requires evaluating model performance separately for different demographic subgroups and monitoring for systematic bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stigmatization risks include the possibility that incorrect obesity classifications could lead to discrimination in insurance or employment contexts. Predictions should be treated as screening tools rather than definitive diagnoses and require human oversight. Over-reliance on automation poses the risk that healthcare providers may depend solely on model predictions without exercising clinical judgment. The system should support decision-making rather than replacing professional medical assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limited generalizability is a concern since the model is trained on Latin American populations and may not transfer to other regions or cultures with different dietary patterns. Limitations must be clearly documented and the model should be validated before deployment in new regions. Synthetic data concerns relate to the fact that 77 percent of training data comes from SMOTE generation, which may introduce artificial patterns not present in real populations. Model behavior should be carefully evaluated and predictions compared on real versus synthetic data subsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature sensitivity presents the risk that the model may learn spurious correlations such as gender stereotypes about eating habits. This requires analyzing feature importance and testing for protected attribute influence.

    "The ethical sensitivity assessment identified several attributes requiring careful consideration. Gender is a protected characteristic under anti-discrimination laws, with risk that the model could learn stereotypes about eating habits or body composition differences between males and females. Age presents similar concerns, particularly since the dataset includes minors (14-17 years) who require special ethical consideration in health interventions. Age-based discrimination in healthcare is regulated in many contexts. Family history with overweight represents potentially sensitive genetic information that could be misused for discrimination based on hereditary predisposition, though it is not typically legally protected.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset exhibits significant class imbalance requiring attention. The Insufficient Weight category represents only 1.4 percent of samples, creating risk of poor model performance on this minority class. Extreme age groups (14-17 and 55+) are underrepresented, potentially limiting model generalization to these populations. The 18-fold difference between the largest class (Obesity Type I at 25.2 percent) and smallest class necessitates stratified evaluation and macro-averaged metrics to ensure balanced performance across all obesity categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "To mitigate these risks, the evaluation includes separate performance analysis by gender and age group to detect disparate impact. The model uses stratified sampling in train-test splits to ensure minority classes receive adequate representation. Deployment recommendations emphasize human oversight to prevent automated decisions that could lead to discrimination or stigmatization based on protected attributes.\n",

    "The data preparation phase applied several preprocessing actions to ensure data quality and model readiness. First, the dataset was cleaned by removing 24 duplicate records identified during quality assessment. Second, feature engineering was performed by calculating BMI (Body Mass Index) from height and weight measurements, and creating age group bins to capture life stage effects. Third, encoding strategies were applied appropriately for different feature types: LabelEncoding for the target variable, OrdinalEncoding for ordinal features (food consumption between meals and alcohol consumption), and OneHotEncoding for the nominal transportation mode feature. Finally, all continuous features were standardized to have mean zero and standard deviation one, ensuring equal weighting in model training.\n",

    "Feature engineering analysis identified several potential derived attributes. BMI (Body Mass Index) was calculated using the formula Weight divided by Height squared. Although the model has access to Height and Weight separately, providing the explicit BMI ratio helps decision trees make cleaner splits, as BMI is historically the strongest predictor for obesity classification.\n",

    "Age grouping through binning was applied to convert the continuous Age variable into categories representing youth, adult, and senior life stages. This transformation helps the model capture non-linear patterns, as lifestyle habits change significantly across life stages. A 20-year-old and 50-year-old with the same weight may have very different health risk profiles.\n",

    "A sedentary ratio combining technology use time and physical activity was considered but rejected. This would have created a ratio of time spent using technology divided by physical activity frequency to quantify sedentary lifestyle. However, this approach posed technical challenges due to participants with zero physical activity (causing division by zero errors) and information loss concerns. Combining these metrics might obscure the individual impacts of excessive sedentary behavior versus insufficient physical activity, so they were kept as separate features.\n",
    "\n",
    "A healthy diet score summing vegetable intake and water consumption while subtracting high-calorie food was also rejected. This aggregation would lose important information, as individuals who consume both high vegetables and high junk food differ meaningfully from those who consume neither.

Integrating data from Fitbits or Apple Health (Step count, Heart Rate Variability, Active Energy Burn). This would replace subjective \"feelings\" about activity with hard facts, drastically reducing noise in the FAF (Physical Activity) feature.\n",
    "2.Socio-Economic & Location Data: Obesity is often strongly correlated with income and location (access to healthy food). Linking user Zip Codes to average household income or \"Food Desert\" maps. This would help the model understand if someone eats junk food (FAVC) by choice or because fresh produce isn't available in their area.\n",
    "3. Medical & Genetic History: The dataset assumes weight is 100% lifestyle. It ignores metabolism. The Data like Thyroid function tests, hormone levels, or genetic markers.

    "For the modeling phase, we selected the Random Forest classifier as our primary algorithm. This decision was driven by several key considerations. The dataset contains seven different obesity levels as target classes, with approximately 77% of the data being synthetic records generated through SMOTE augmentation. Random Forest is an ensemble method that demonstrates strong robustness against overfitting on synthetic patterns, making it well-suited for this augmented dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm also handles outliers effectively, which is important given the outliers identified in the Age and number of main meals attributes during data quality assessment. Unlike linear models, Random Forest can capture non-linear relationships between features and obesity levels without being heavily influenced by extreme values. Another significant advantage is that Random Forest provides feature importance rankings, which aligns perfectly with our public health scenario where stakeholders need to understand which lifestyle habits have the most impact on obesity classification. This interpretability supports the development of targeted intervention strategies based on the most influential behavioral factors.\n",

For our tuning experiments, we selected maximum depth as the primary parameter to optimize. This choice is justified by its direct control over individual tree complexity. Since the dataset contains 77% synthetic records generated by SMOTE, there is substantial risk of the model learning noise or artificial patterns from the augmented data. Tuning maximum depth allows us to find the optimal balance between model bias and variance, ensuring better generalization to real-world obesity screening scenarios while preventing overfitting to synthetic patterns.\n",

    "The final Random Forest model achieved 98.56% test accuracy, which comfortably exceeds the 90% threshold we set in the business success criteria. Performance is solid across all seven obesity categories, giving public health agencies a reliable tool for early risk identification.\n",
    "\n",
    "For deployment, we'd recommend treating this as a screening tool rather than a diagnostic system. The model should help clinic staff in Mexico, Peru, and Colombia flag potentially at-risk individuals, but any classification needs verification by a healthcare professional before taking action. This is especially important for unusual cases - someone with an atypical combination of eating habits and activity levels might not fit the patterns the model learned from training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interface should show confidence scores and explain which factors drove each prediction. If the system flags someone as Obesity Type II, the healthcare provider should see that this was based on, say, high calorie food consumption, low vegetable intake, and sedentary behavior. This transparency helps providers have more informed conversations with patients and builds trust in the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Long-term, the model will need regular check-ups. As dietary trends change or new transportation patterns emerge, the model's accuracy could drift. Setting up a retraining schedule based on periodic audits will keep the system reliable over time. The monitoring plan below details how to catch performance drops before they become problematic.\n",

    "\n",
    "# 6b: ethical aspects and risks identified for deployment\n",
    "# mention the smote data and geographic limitations\n",
    "# 6b: Ethical Aspects and Risks\n",
    "ethical_aspects_comment = \"\"\"\n",
    "The biggest ethical concern here is the dataset composition. According to the Kaggle documentation, roughly 77% of our training data came from SMOTE synthetic augmentation. While SMOTE helped us handle the severe class imbalance (Insufficient Weight was only 1.4% of the original data), there's inherent risk in training on mostly artificial examples. The synthetic records might not capture the full complexity of real patients, particularly edge cases with unusual characteristic combinations. Before deployment, we'd want to validate performance on a fully real-world test set from actual clinic screenings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The geographic scope is another limitation worth emphasizing. This model learned patterns from individuals in Mexico, Peru, and Colombia. Food culture, transportation infrastructure, and lifestyle norms vary dramatically between Latin America and other regions. Someone in Norway or Thailand might have completely different eating patterns and activity levels even at the same BMI. Rolling this out beyond the three original countries without retraining would be risky at best, potentially discriminatory at worst.\n",
    "\n",
    "Privacy is critical since we're handling sensitive health data: weight, eating habits, family medical history. The classification results could theoretically be misused for insurance discrimination or employment decisions. Deployment needs strict access controls ensuring predictions are used solely for medical support, not shared with insurers or employers. GDPR compliance is mandatory, and local health privacy regulations in each country need to be followed.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's also the stigma problem. Getting classified into a higher obesity category carries social weight. If providers aren't trained to communicate results sensitively, patients could feel judged rather than supported. The system needs to emphasize that these are screening results to guide health conversations, not labels that define someone's worth. Training materials for healthcare staff should stress supportive, non-judgmental communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, there's the automation dependency risk. When a tool is consistently accurate (like our 98.56% test performance), people start to trust it blindly. Providers might stop questioning predictions even when their clinical judgment says something seems off. The deployment needs clear guidelines that the model is one input among many, and providers retain full responsibility for patient care decisions.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6c: monitoring plan during deployment\n",
    "# define triggers for intervention\n",
    "monitoring_plan_comment = \"\"\"\n",
    "Keeping the model reliable requires monitoring at two levels. First, we need to track data drift by checking whether new patients look statistically different from our training population. Monthly checks on eating patterns (high-calorie food, vegetable consumption, meals per day), activity levels, and transportation modes will catch significant shifts. Something like Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests or Population Stability Index calculations would work here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we need regular accuracy audits against manual clinical assessments. A representative sample each month should get traditional obesity evaluations to establish ground truth, stratified by age, gender, and obesity category. If overall accuracy drops below 85%, or if any demographic subgroup falls under 75%, that triggers an immediate review to investigate root causes and determine whether retraining is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Monthly reports should summarize drift indicators, audit results, and any alerts. A governance committee (data scientists, clinicians, ethics specialists) reviews these quarterly to make decisions about maintenance timing. Version control needs to support rollback - if a new model version behaves unexpectedly, we should be able to revert to the previous stable version immediately.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6d: reflection on reproducibility\n",
    "reproducibility_reflection_comment = \"\"\"\n",
    "For reproducibility purposes we used fixed random seeds (42) throughout - data splitting, SMOTE augmentation, Random Forest training. The GraphDB provenance tracks every step, so the methodology is fully documented.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, there are a few gotchas. Library versions matter - different scikit-learn versions might handle Random Forest splitting slightly differently, or SMOTE might vary between releases. The requirements.txt pins our exact versions, but someone running this later might have trouble installing old versions. Platform differences (Intel vs ARM processors) could also introduce tiny numerical variations, though not enough to change conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset needs to remain accessible too. If the Kaggle dataset goes offline or gets updated, future researchers won't be able to recreate our starting point. For best reproducibility, we'd want to archive: the complete notebook, frozen requirements, the original dataset, the GraphDB export, and the serialized final model. With those materials and our deterministic configuration, other researchers should be able to validate our results.\n",

    "This report documents a complete CRISP-DM implementation for obesity level classification using data from Mexico, Peru, and Colombia. We developed a Random Forest classifier achieving 98.56\\\\% test accuracy across seven obesity categories. The analysis covers business understanding, data quality assessment, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and comprehensive evaluation including bias analysis. Results exceed baseline performance by 81 percentage points and align with state-of-the-art benchmarks. Deployment recommendations address ethical concerns regarding synthetic training data and propose a hybrid human-in-the-loop approach for clinical screening applications.\n",
