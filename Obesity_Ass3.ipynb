    "A public health agency in Latin America aims to combat the rising obesity epidemic\n",

    "   high-risk who receive targeted interventions show measurable improvement\n",
    "   (BMI reduction of at least 2 points).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Cost-Effectiveness:** Reduce overall healthcare costs related to obesity\n",

    "   - Overweight Level I\n",

    "3. **Balanced Performance:** Achieve strong performance across all obesity\n",
    "   categories, not just the majority classes, ensuring reliable predictions\n",
    "   for minority obesity types.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Generalization:** Develop a model that generalizes well across different\n",
    "   demographic groups (age ranges, genders) and geographic regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Interpretability:** Create a model whose predictions can be explained to\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Balanced Performance:**\n",
    "   - Macro-averaged F1-score ≥ 0.85\n",

    "   - Macro-averaged precision ≥ 0.85\n",

    "Several AI risk aspects require consideration:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Health Data Privacy:**\n",
    "   - Risk: Exposure of sensitive health information (weight, eating habits)\n",
    "   - Mitigation: Ensure anonymization, secure data handling, GDPR compliance\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Bias and Fairness:**\n",
    "   - Risk: Model may perform differently across genders, age groups, or\n",
    "     geographic regions, leading to unfair treatment\n",
    "   - Concern: 77% synthetic data may not accurately represent real-world\n",
    "     distributions\n",
    "   - Action: Evaluate model performance separately for different demographic\n",
    "     subgroups; monitor for systematic bias\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Stigmatization:**\n",
    "   - Risk: Incorrect obesity classification could lead to stigmatization,\n",
    "     discrimination in insurance/employment\n",
    "   - Mitigation: Predictions should be treated as screening tools, not\n",
    "     definitive diagnoses; require human oversight\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Over-reliance on Automation:**\n",
    "   - Risk: Healthcare providers may rely solely on model predictions without\n",
    "     clinical judgment\n",
    "   - Mitigation: System should support decision-making, not replace professional\n",
    "     medical assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Limited Generalizability:**\n",
    "   - Risk: Model trained on Latin American populations may not generalize to\n",
    "     other regions/cultures with different dietary patterns\n",
    "   - Action: Clearly document limitations; validate before deployment in new\n",
    "     regions\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Synthetic Data Concerns:**\n",
    "   - Risk: 77% SMOTE-generated data may introduce artificial patterns not\n",
    "     present in real populations\n",
    "   - Action: Carefully evaluate model behavior; compare predictions on real vs.\n",
    "     synthetic data subsets\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Feature Sensitivity:**\n",
    "   - Risk: Model may learn spurious correlations (e.g., gender stereotypes\n",
    "     about eating habits)\n",
    "   - Action: Analyze feature importance; test for protected attribute influence\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Intervention Harm:**\n",
    "   - Risk: False positives could lead to unnecessary interventions; false\n",
    "     negatives could miss at-risk individuals\n",
    "   - Mitigation: Establish appropriate confidence thresholds; implement\n",
    "     human-in-the-loop verification for critical cases\n",

    "    * Reason: Our specific goal is to classify obesity types. The \"outliers\" are actually the people with Obesity Type III. If we remove them to \"clean\" the data, we would delete the exact class we are trying to predict. In this medical context, extreme values are real data, not noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Imputation of Missing Values:\n",
    "    * Observation: We ran df.isnull().sum() and checked the dataset documentation.\n",
    "    * Result: The dataset is completely full (0 null values).\n",
    "    * Decision: No imputation (filling gaps with mean/median) was necessary because the data quality is already perfect in this regard.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Dimensionality Reduction (PCA):\n",
    "    * Idea: We considered using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to combine features and make the model faster.\n",
    "    * Decision: SKIPPED.\n",
    "    * Reason: Our business goal includes \"Interpretability\". We need to tell users why they are classified as obese (e.g., \"because you don't eat vegetables\"). PCA turns features into abstract math (Component 1, Component 2) which cannot be explained to a doctor or patient.\n",

    "3.  \"Sedentary Ratio\" (TUE / FAF) - [REJECTED]:\n",
    "    * Idea: Create a ratio of \"Time on Technology\" divided by \"Physical Activity\" to quantify a sedentary lifestyle.\n",
    "    * Problem: Many participants have FAF = 0 (no activity). This causes division-by-zero errors. Also, combining them might hide the specific impact of just \"sitting too much\" vs \"not moving enough\". We kept them separate.\n",

    "The current dataset is limited to self-reported surveys. We identified three external sources that would significantly improve model quality in a real-world project:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Objective Wearable Data (IoT):\n",
    "    * The Problem: People lie on surveys. They overestimate how much they run and underestimate how much they sit.\n",
    "    * The Solution: Integrating data from Fitbits or Apple Health (Step count, Heart Rate Variability, Active Energy Burn).\n",
    "    * Impact: This would replace subjective \"feelings\" about activity with hard facts, drastically reducing noise in the FAF (Physical Activity) feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Socio-Economic & Location Data:\n",
    "    * The Context: Obesity is often strongly correlated with income and location (access to healthy food).\n",
    "    * The Data: Linking user Zip Codes to average household income or \"Food Desert\" maps.\n",
    "    * Impact: This would help the model understand if someone eats junk food (FAVC) by choice or because fresh produce isn't available in their area.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Medical & Genetic History:\n",
    "    * The Missing Link: The dataset assumes weight is 100% lifestyle. It ignores metabolism.\n",
    "    * The Data: Thyroid function tests, hormone levels, or genetic markers.\n",
    "    * Impact: This would identify patients who are obese due to medical conditions, not just diet. Currently, the model might unfairly classify these patients based on their \"average\" diet.\n",
